1. for sarnn, policys not sum to 1
should be:
0.2 0.3 0.0(should always be 0)
0.3 0.3 0.4
0.5 0.4 0.6

and cumprod:
1.0 0.20 0.060
0.3 0.06 0.024
0.5 0.08 0.036

note that, now the last two row sums to 1

2. for sarnn, it can never conquer parenthesized cases:
(1) policy should be based on mem and next_inp, e.g.:
    a. 5+3*2 v.s. 5*3*2
    b. (1) v.s. (1+2)
(2) should be able to reduce more than once at one time step, e.g.:
    (1+(2+(3+(4+5))))
